# HAB-CTI Database Schemas
This folder contains each revision of the database schema we created based on feedback.

The Version 1 through Version 5 folders contain MySQL workbench files, png exports of the entity relationship diagram,
and SQL scripts to create the database.

The PostgreSQL folder contains a special version of the SQL database creation script made for PostgreSQL.
There are a few differences in supported data types between MySQL and PostgreSQL and various database settings which
have been removed.

In the future if the database remains as PostgreSQL, we recommend moving away from MySQL workbench for creating
new database models and utilizing other tools such as DBeaver community edition to avoid having to modify the SQL
files generated by the modeling tool.

Additional database design tools for PostgreSQL can be found on the PostgreSQL wiki:
