# Generic Selenium Webscraper
This was the original prototype web scraper we built. It takes a user provided URL and attempt to scrape information
from the provided URL. Unlike all other web scrapers in this repository, this uses Selenium instead of PlayWright. No
data is written to files, and information the web scraper gathers is printed to the console instead.

***IMPORTANT NOTE***: **This web scraper uses Apple Safari as the webdriver meaning it will not function on Windows or
Linux without modification.**
