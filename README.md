# IMET Web Scraping Tools
This repository contains the tools developed to automate the extraction of water-related 
regulations from a variety of online sources, including local, state, and 
federal websites. The goal of this project is to streamline the collection 
of regulatory information for integration into a centralized relational database. These tools 
are part of a broader initiative at the Institute of Marine and Environmental Technology (IMET) 
to support research related to harmful algal blooms and water protection. 
By automating regulatory data collection, this project reduces manual effort and 
enhances the efficiency of the research process for researchers, scientists, and 
stakeholders.
